                <p>
                    Quixote Cottage, a private and remote farmstay, offers a "European getaway" experience in San Diego near Julian. Nestled on a hillside overlooking a 15-acre citrus grove, the 900 sqft, 2-bedroom cottage provides a quiet retreat with a wrap-around deck, BBQ, and seating for six. The cottage, located within our family's working ranch, affords access to the orchard, our rescue horses, and the pool (May-Sept, 3-hour daily max). Tours of the ranch and guided hikes are available on request. As an agritourism destination and organic farm, it offers a unique experience distinct from a five-star resort. Ideal for relaxation, not recommended as a base for San Diego sightseeing due to traffic. Small, pre-approved dinner parties acceptable. Please read the Guidebook prior to arrival.
